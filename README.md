This applies for each byte one by one. The next 2 bytes are the port. They are a big endian unsigned short. |

Bedrock Edition is 10. If the protocol version of the
client is not the same as the server's the server responds
with a Incompatible Protocol Version packet

# Ack/Nak

## Records

A record can either be a single sequence number or a
range between 2 sequence numbers (if we have 1 and 8
the numbers will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]).
The receiver should check the validity of the range.
